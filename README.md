DevTools is a combination of tools, extensions, and code ment to simplify development

## Core

Core is the base of DevTools, representing some of the most used, underused, complicated or forgotten code. This is to help simplify your projects.

## Sierra

Sierra is a modified version of Toast. Although only in it's infancy, there are big plans set ahead for this small tool to give developers who need more than just two lines the ability to modify and adjust the tool in ways they need to efficantly test their apps.

Sierra is unique in it's ability to be relocated anywhere around the screen and reset to the top left. You can also set the content of Sierra to any string you need to help you debug your app.

## Extensions

Extensions are the heart and sole of developers, and with DevTools, we are trying to give you the most used, most useful, and best in one place. From checking if a string is an email, to adding a view to another view and sending it to the back. There is a large list of them and we will only add the ones that are non-intrusive, do not conflict with the system, and benifit everyone!

# Worried about the Apple App Store?

## We have passed 100% of the time

Dev Tools is based on Apple code, and NOT third party libraries or private libraries. We are non-intrusive to iOS, macOS, tvOS, or watchOS. This means our SDK is not against any of Apple's Developer Guidelines. We cannot garuntee our SDK with Google's Developer Guidelines or Windows Developer Guidelines, nor have we tested our SDK with them (although this IS a goal in the future).

## Other Platforms

We do not garuntee the status, support, or state of our SDK on non-Apple platforms. We wish you all the luck and ask you PLEASE report any bugs!

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

A love for simplifying your projects

## Installation

DevTools is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
